# TranscriptingMIDIfile
Playing multiple MIDI files together.

The code has the following WorkFlow

1.Reading the MIDI files
NOTE: The MIDI files used here belong to chords of a particular family such that, 
when played simultaneously creates a chord pattern. 

2. Selecting an instrument for each MIDI file from the JAVA Sound Bank.

3. Calculating the tempo from the files

4. Pooling multiple threads to play them simultaneously. 

This piece of code is a part of a project that creates a tool which can provide musical accompaniment on the fly customising the type of instrument that an artist wants the playback music to be played in.
